mdmu - A Mifare DESfire Manipulation Utility - From my own brain and no NDA - free your thoughts


How to run this:

```bash
$ ./rfid_prerequisites_script_v0.sh #should only be required once, so hopefully you'll only need it once
$ ./rfid_checkout_script_v0.sh #sometimes things happen, run it sometimes
$ ./rfid_compile_script_v0.sh #please fix stuff daily -> run it as often as needed! (Fix everything until you can't stand it anymore)
$ ./rfid_uninstall_script_v0.sh
```
